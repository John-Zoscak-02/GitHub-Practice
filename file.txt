My name is John and my future desires for employment is to become a soloist violinst in the London symphony orchestra because violas suCCC
My name is Lucas and I will convince the world that soloists, especially violin soloists, are bad for the environment because they cause global warming.
Luckily for John, due to the ridiculousness in nature of Lucas' claims, solo violinists boom in popularity and it is determined by top scientists that violin soloists have in fact, no correlation to global warming whatsoever. As a result of the popularity boom, John, a frontrunner in the violin community, is able to make enough money to continue doing what he loves for life, on top of being able to purchase the better instrument, the viola.
