# Instructions for a random number generator made by John Zosack
This program asks you to input two numbers, but the first number must be greater than the second in order to properly find a random number between the two numbers, and both must be positive. 
**NOTE: the random number generator will not work unless you follow the above instructions**
This random number generator will find a random number between the first and second values that you input.
